# SUN3Dtoolbox

This toolbox contains two independent examples for reading SUN3D.

1. SUN3Dreader.m is a *one-single-file* script that demonstrate how to load SUN3D data. It doesn't requires any external files.

2. SUN3Dloader is a library that you can reuse for your own project without any need to change the code.

Choose one that fits your need. Thanks.
